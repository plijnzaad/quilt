Installing: 

Should be straightforward on any Unix; everything is standard C.  It's
developed and tested mostly on Linux. I have no inclination to spend much
time making it work on other platforms, but I don't think it should be
difficult; it has been tested on other Unices and/or compilers: Digital Unix
(OSF1), SGI, Solaris, AIX.  Be prepared for a fair number of warnings,
especially when compiling on Digital Unix: they sometimes have their RAND_MAX
wrong. Switch off gcc's '-Wall' option if found iritating.


The build requires GNU make. Look at the files setup.sh.example, copy
and adjust, then source it so that BUILD_HOME points to the right place. In
most cases, the settings in setup.example are already fine, so you
can simply

  cd $git/quilt
  source setup.sh.example        # or the csh version if that's your shell

Then look at make.include (specifically at the 'prefix' and 'bindir'
variables) and the Makefiles, and with a bit of luck,

  make
  make test
  make install

will just work .  If you change prefix and bindir from their default values
(/usr/local{/bin}), be sure to adjust the PATH in setup.sh[.example]
accordingly, otherwise the binary cannot be found. 

The files ATOMS and RESIDUES are needed by the pdb reading routines; install
or symlink them as ~/.atoms and ~/.residues. You can edit these files to
adjust atom radii etc. The format of these two files is should be obvious;
see also their comments.

After compiling/installing, all a user needs to do is to source the
setup{.sh,csh} file in order to find the binary and PDB files.  The 'API' is
documented in the .h files, -ish, and the files README and
scripts/one-structure.sh should be helpful too. Any questions/suggestions,
feel free to ask me.
