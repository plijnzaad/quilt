	* 0.9p: some general polishing, now big changes.

Fri May  5 01:35:29 2000    <lijnzaad@ebi.ac.uk>

	* renamed v09a to v09i, because 09a is out there already.

	* polished documentation; put everything under CVS control; added
	 stuff for more easily building tar files. tagged and versioned as
	 v09a.
